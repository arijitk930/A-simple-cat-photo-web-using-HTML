# A-simple-cat-photo-web-using-HTML
I just created a simple cat photo website which I just learned from frecodecamp.org using only html.
This website holds some knowledges about cats , the things cats love to eat, the things cat hates basically a personality of a cat.
Also I created a cat form which helps me to understand how a form can be created.
